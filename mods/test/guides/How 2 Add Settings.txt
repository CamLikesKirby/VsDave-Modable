First off in data folder go to the charts folder and copy the test json file and name it yoursong-settings.json

Example:

{
      "songCreators": "The Song Creators",
      "songHeadings": "theHeading",
      "creditsTxt": "the txt"
  }



To make a image of the song creator(s) go to images\songCreators

copy the example image and edit it with the song creator(s) icons make sure it's named like the credit pop up

you can make a custom heading too by going to images\songHeadings

Copy the example image and edit it make sure it's the same name as the heading you chosen or you can take a heading that is already in the asstes like bambiHeading
