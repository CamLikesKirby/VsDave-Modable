First go to charts and put your chart there (make sure to only have the song name)

if your going to have a extra key difficulty as well do this:

songname-extrakeys

Now put your inst and voices into the songs folder (Make sure that files are oggs and they are in a folder that is your song name)

For Freeplay:

Go to data and select customSongs.txt

delete the test song if you want to and replace it with this:

yoursong:1:characternameforicon

you can put multiple to by doing this:

yoursong:1:characternameforicon
yoursong:1:characternameforicon
yoursong:1:characternameforicon

The number is a array from 0 to 16:

var songColors:Array<FlxColor> =	[
    	0xFF00137F,    // GF but its actually dave!
		0xFF4965FF,    // DAVE
		0xFF00B515,    // MISTER BAMBI RETARD (thats kinda rude ngl)
		0xFF00FFFF,    // SPLIT THE THONNNNN
		0xFF800080,    // FESTIVAL
		0xFF116E1C,    // MASTA BAMBI
		0xFFFF0000,    // KABUNGA
		0xFF0EAE2C,    // SECRET MOD LEAK
		0xFFFF0000,    // TRISTAN
		FlxColor.fromRGB(162, 150, 188), // PLAYROBOT
		FlxColor.fromRGB(44, 44, 44),    // RECURSED
		0xFF31323F,    // MOLDY
		0xFF35396C,    // FIVE NIGHT
		0xFF0162F5,    // OVERDRIVE
		0xFF119A2B,    // CHEATING
		0xFFFF0000,    // UNFAIRNESS
		0xFF810000,    // EXPLOITATION 
    ];

Now your song is playable (open up the chart editor to edit the characters and the stage)

Story Mode:

In the data folder open up weeks.json

you put your songs into the songlist array

the week name is what shows up as a desc of your custom week

the weekBanner is the name of your .png banner in images\weekBanners

in images\storymenu make sure your first custom week is named week6 and the other one week7 and so on

to add more weeks replace the last curly bracket (}) with this:

},
		{
			"songList": ["Test", "Test"],
			"weekName": "Test Week",
			"bannerName": "testbanner"
		}
	  ]
	}
