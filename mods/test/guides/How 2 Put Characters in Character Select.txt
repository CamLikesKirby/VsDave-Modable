First off go to data open the characterSelect json

it should have a example of a character and a character with different forms

you can replace it with this:
{
      "characters": [
        {
          "newCharacter": [
            {
              "playername": "nameofchar",
              "thecharactername": "Name of Char in Character Select Menu",
              "thenotems": [1, 1, 1, 1],
              "notestyle": "3D or just put nothing"
            }
          ],
          "mainName": "Will be the name if you get a highscore with the character",
          "mainnotems": [1, 1, 1, 1]
        }
      ]
    }

you can add more characters by doing this replacing the last curly bracket (}):

 },
        {
          "newCharacter": [
            {
              "playername": "nameofchar",
              "thecharactername": "Name of Char in Character Select Menu",
              "thenotems": [1, 1, 1, 1],
              "notestyle": "3D or just put nothing"
            }
          ],
          "mainName": "Will be the name if you get a highscore with the character",
          "mainnotems": [1, 1, 1, 1]
        }
      ]
    }
