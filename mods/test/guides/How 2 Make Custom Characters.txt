JSON:

First, go to the data folder, then the characters folder. You should see an example character (Bandu). Copy it and rename it to your character's name, ensuring it does not contain any uppercase letters. open your xml file and rename the 
anim like this:

 "animName": "singUP",
 "anim": "xmlup",
 "fps": 24,
 "loop": false
 },
 {
 "animName": "singLEFT",
 "anim": "xmlleft",
 "fps": 24,
 "loop": false

and so on

The global offset changes the character's X and Y positions.

To make the character playable, you need an offset file named like this: charactername-playable (We will explain the offsets later).

Skins are for things like the 3D segment (Polygonized) and in Recursed when you miss too many letter notes. This is what you should put in the skin array if you want skins:

 {
        "type": "3d",
        "replacement": "charnamehere"
      },
      {
        "type": "recursed",
        "replacement": "charnamehere"
      }

bar color just changes the characters bar color

nativelyPlayable flips the left and right sides of the character.

Graphic Size has three options

furiosityScale (For small 3d characters)

daPixelZoom (For Pixel Characters)

Or you can just type in a number

for effect also has there options

3dfloat (Gives the character 3d notes and makes them float)

float (Just makes the character float)

3d (Just gives them 3d notes)

put your json name in customCharacterList txt file

IMAGES AND OFFSETS:

When you're done, go to the images folder and select the characters folder. Put your spritesheet and XML file in there (they both must be named the same as the JSON).

Next, go to the icons folder and put your icons (make sure they are named the same as the JSON).

Then, go to the offset folder, copy the example file, and rename it to the JSON name.

If you selected isPlayable for the JSON, create another text file named jsonname-playable.

now go in the game and select your character from the chart menu

Now, go into the game and select your character from the chart menu. If the positions are off, edit the globalOffset and the text file.

and you should be done!

 (For putting your character in the character select, go to the "How 2 put characters in character select" txt file.)
