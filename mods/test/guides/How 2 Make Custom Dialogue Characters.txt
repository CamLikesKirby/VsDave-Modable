This System is kinda unstable right now so before I tell you how to add custom dialogue characters I will teach you how to do it in a alternative way

so just do this

:generic: Bambi OC: I am bambi oc lolololol
:generic: Dave OC: I am dave oc wait I don't exist

(Make sure you don't put the name of the character near the : if your doing charactername:)

But if you stil want to use custom dialogue characters then follow this:

go to data\characters\dialogue

copy the test json make rename it to anything you like

the x and y don't do anything for something yet so just set right to true

now go to images\dialogue

copy the test folder and rename to your json name

make sure to edit the image name like this

jsonname_normal

you can make more expressions just make sure it's formatted like this:

jsonname_expression

in dialogue to use your custom character do this: 

:jsonname,expression: I am custom character
